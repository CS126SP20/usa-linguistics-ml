---
- **4/17/20** Sketched project outline/skeleton
- **4/21/20** Compiled and linked external *dlib* library
- **4/23/20** Outlined the user survey
   - Divided regional selection into four regions
   - Selected six questions based on their differentiation ability
- **4/26/20** Calculated probabilities of specific responses by region
    - Based off of state-by-state data from [Harvard Dialect Survey](http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/maps.html) 
    - Still need to create training data utilizing the aforementioned probabilities
- **4/28/20** Created training data for user responses and answers based on survey probabilities
    - Implemented object type 'Response' to store example answers to linguistic questions
- **4/30/20** Create and write the proposal into this GitHub repository.
    - Essentially similar to the original approved proposal but simply relocated.
