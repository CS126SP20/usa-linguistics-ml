- **4/23/20** Outlined the user survey
   - Divided regional selection into four regions
   - Selected six questions based on their differentiation ability
- **4/26/20** Calculated probabilities of specific responses by region
    - Based off of state-by-state data from [Harvard Dialect Survey](http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/maps.html) 
    - Still need to create training data utilizing the aforementioned probabilities
